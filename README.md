This project employs machine learning techniques, particularly K-means clustering, to segment customers based on their credit card usage behavior, facilitating the development of tailored marketing strategies. In a fiercely competitive financial landscape, understanding customer behavior is pivotal for effective marketing campaigns. Leveraging summary data from 9000 active credit card holders over 6 months, we utilize BigQuery ML to perform K-means clustering on features like balance, purchases, and cash advances. The outcome is distinct customer segments, each offering valuable insights for crafting targeted offers and enhancing customer engagement. By aligning marketing efforts with customer preferences, businesses can drive growth and maintain a competitive edge in the financial industry.
